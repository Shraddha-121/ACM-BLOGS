Android or Web? So basically, I will say that totally is an independent choice. In what does your interests lie? So here are some questions that will let you decide your priorities:

Am I a newbie?
What will matter more in my resumeüìù?
What will guarantee me an excellent placement?
Do I love intensive programming? How far am I willing to go?
What is easy to learn? What is in more demand (Android | Web)?
What will pay me moreüí∞?
So here are the 6 factors that I have listed out that will let you compare what you want to choose: Web Development / Android Development. Let‚Äôs Go!!!

Learning Curve (What‚Äôs Easy)
Funny fact!!! You have to learn bothüòÇ. Let‚Äôs differentiate according to the complexity of the projects you want to build.

Simple Android Project
For building a simple Android Project you basically need Android Studio Software. Download an Emulator if you want. You additionally have to set up the libraries & sdk files.

PS ‚Äî Need a high-end laptop (explained further), Learn Java, Kotlin, or Dart.

Simple Web Project
You just need a simple Notepad & a simple browser for web development. Save it using .html extension and BOOMüí•. You have created your first web development project. Add a little CSS to make it look beautiful.

Additionally, for Android development, you have to be updated with the new Android system updates, otherwise your apps would be deprecated on the Play Store. For advanced Web projects, you have to additionally learn Angular JS or Vue JS or maybe React Libraries.

Placements (What‚Äôs Beneficial)
If you have some medium or high-level real-life Android/IOS applications mentioned in your CV, then it shows that you are passionate about coding or learning coding from scratch. It also shows your creativity as well as your knowledge of Android as an Operating System.

If a company visits your campusüßë‚Äçüéì, you definitely have an edge over others, as in interviews the questions are often asked about the Android system. Even if you are not good at Data Structures & Algorithmsüìö, Android development could be your biggest advantage.

Deploy a Production
Web
If you are a student or a developer, GitHub is an excellent platform to deploy your web-based projects. You can subscribe to the GitHub Student Pack for FREE. Personally, this has helped me a lot as a developer. Stay tuned!!! Visit my profile to know more.

Android
For hosting of apps, there aren‚Äôt many free resources available. The standard way is you have to sign into a Google Developer account and buy the subscription for $25 (roughly ‚Çπ2000), then meet the Google requirements to host your app on the Play Store.

Additionally, there are many free and cool websites that offer you free domain names and hosting other than GitHub. Also, you can build your .apk file from Android Studio and share them via a sharing app with your friends and colleagues rather than hosting it.

System Requirements
Android
An Android Developer really requires a high-end, i.e., minimum (4GB) RAM (I recommend 8GB or else you will get frustrated). Also, a minimum of i3 intel processor and a graphic card would be a plus point for developersüòä.

Web
Only a Notepad or Visual Studio Code (for better visualization) and a simple browser would efficiently run the web code smoothly.

Supply VS Demand
Here, Android Development has a significant edge over Web development. Let me explain with an example:

Example: From the early 90‚Äôs, websites have been available on the internet. But in the last decade, mobile applications have boomed in the market. Every day we use multiple apps on our mobiles rather than visiting a website of the same, but many are still not available.

Thus, the supply is very less for an Android developer and very less for an iOS developer. But in case of web development, many web developers who have literally researched in the field of web development are readily available.

Thus, even if you are from a Tier-3 college, you can get a job in a Product-Based Company with a hefty package based on the skillset of an Android / iOS developer.

Salaryüí∏ (Package)
This totally depends upon whether you are in a Product-Based or Service-Based company.

Product-Based
In these types of companies, you usually enter as a Software Engineer. You get to choose your field if you want Android or Web. Also, in Web Development, you can get to choose as a Backend or Frontend developer, or a Full Stack developer. Task is assigned, you learn and go for it. Basically, the salary of Software Engineers ranges between 6LPA to 14LPA for freshers and increases beyond.

Service-Based
In these companies, you are entitled to a single post like Java developer, Android or Web developer, etc. Thus, your packages get divided too. But in Service-Based companies too, Android Developer‚Äôs supply is less, whereas the package offered is more than normal. Usually, the package offered is between 3LPA to 8LPA.

Conclusion
So, Guys after reading this, I guess your doubts have been resolved regarding what to choose between Web and Android Development. Do not waste much time thinking and just go for it!!! Just master what you like & you would be unstoppableüöÄ.

I have done and continuously doing some Android and Web development projects in college and showcasing them on GitHub. Go there and star‚≠ê the repository if you like them!!!

If you have any doubts, reach out to me on LinkedIn or Twitter, and we will surely discuss them.

PCs in the 1970s, the internet in the 1990s, and smartphones in the 2000s revolutionized the way we do daily activities in ways never imagined before. Well, another revolution is around the corner and just half a decade or so away. AI/ML, Web 3.0, Metaverse are the fields everyone is pondering about, and this list of fields gets completed with the addition of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) ‚Äî and that‚Äôs the theme of our blog too!

VR headsets, which debuted commercially just a few years ago, have exponentially grown in the VR ‚ÄúGaming‚Äù domain. Very soon, professors and students will use VR for education, corporates for conducting virtual meetings (thus saving time and money), and companies for training employees, warehouse, and factory workers. VR is also an essential part of the upcoming Metaverse.

Headsets, as of now, are quite expensive, but I strongly believe that just as mid-ranged and affordable smartphones are presently available, there will be mid-ranged and affordable headsets as well in the future. Apple CEO Tim Cook said, "I‚Äôm excited about AR. My view is it‚Äôs the next big thing and it will persuade our entire lives."

Imagine calling, texting, and getting 3D navigation to your destination straight from your wearable glasses! Yes, all this is possible because of full-fledged AR glasses. Silicon Valley companies like Apple, Meta, Google, and Microsoft are working on it, and its development has commenced. The day is not so far when we have lightweight AR glasses on our heads.

Like VR, AR too has applications in e-commerce, the military (Microsoft HoloLens), education, and more. This blog is an interesting read for inquisitive minds, curious to understand what VR and AR hold for us in our hands.</p>

Chaitanya Kamble

When is the time for a new revolution in prototyping technology?
While attending a casting class during my Mechanical Engineering studies, I found myself pondering the future of casting and prototyping technologies. It made me wonder about the potential advancements in the field.

Casting and prototyping, as we know them today, rely heavily on external forces shaping the material. For example, 3D printing builds up layers of material to form a shape, often in the form of stacking thousands of 2D triangles in 3D space. Similarly, extrusion processes use molds to transform material through re-crystallization, while sand casting relies on molds to form shapes after melting the material. Across these techniques, the shape is determined by an external mold or by the instructions of a computer.

How does it give a wave for the future?
However, when we start talking about 4D printing, we enter a new era. 4D printing is the first step toward looking at material transformation from the inside out, rather than simply reshaping its exterior. This marks the beginning of what I believe will be a transformative approach in casting technologies.

The concept I am referring to is "casting intelligence" ‚Äî a technology that allows the material itself to transform its shape and properties (such as density) autonomously. What makes this truly revolutionary is that the material would make decisions independently, without relying on an external source like a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) or any other form of electrical computing.

In essence, this vision suggests that the material itself will have its own intelligence, enabling it to "think" and react, making decisions on how it should change based on its internal processes.

This idea could lead to the next step in casting technology ‚Äî one where the material is not just shaped externally, but can evolve and adapt based on its own inherent properties. This would be the true future of casting, where material behavior and design decisions are more dynamic and self-directed.</p>

                <p class="inside-text">Cryptocurrency: Are They Great or a Threat
Cryptocurrencies have emerged in the investing world as a revolutionary change and gained immense popularity because of their ability to soar or make one rich.

Advantages of Cryptocurrency
Decentralization
It acts as a major advantage in the case of cryptocurrencies. Decentralization helps the creators or developers who release the coins in the market to own a certain percent of the coin, thus having control over the trends of the coin and avoiding monopoly.

Secure
Cryptocurrencies are extremely secure because the blockchain is created on difficult mathematical puzzles, making it hard to decode and hack into.

Environmental Effect of Crypto Mining
Initially unnoticed, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin consume a significant amount of electricity, indirectly affecting nature. Bitcoin, especially, consumes about 91 terawatt-hours of electricity annually, which accounts for about half a percent of the world's electricity consumption‚Äîand this usage is increasing daily.

Viable Solutions
Altcoins
There exist ‚Äúaltcoins‚Äù that are less harmful to the environment. They differ from traditional coins in the process or technology of creation. They also vary by the method of transaction. For instance:

Bitcoin uses the ‚Äúproof of work‚Äù protocol, which is power-exhaustive.
Altcoins like Ethereum utilize the ‚Äúproof of stake‚Äù protocol, which considers environmental impacts.
Scientific Innovations
Scientists are actively researching methods to reduce power consumption for cryptocurrency mining. For example, scientists from 3M have developed cooling technologies for data centers, paving the way for more energy-efficient operations.</p>

Cryptocurrency solves the potential flaw in digital banking known as double-spending. Let me explain double-spending through an example: if a person buys a sandwich worth ten rupees, for instance, they cannot spend that same ten-rupee bill anywhere else. But when the same amount is paid digitally, some people can manipulate systems and spend the same ten rupees more than once. That, in simple words, is double-spending. To stop this from happening, we have banks and credit card companies acting as middlemen, so they vouch for the transactions you make and prove that you've already paid for something, while at the same time taking their cut of the transactions. Cryptocurrencies solve both of these issues. Bitcoin is the first implementation of cryptocurrency in blockchain technology.

Blockchain Technology
Blockchain is the technology that enables the existence of cryptocurrencies. Think of it like a computer file that stores data, but this file is across a vast network of computers and is not exclusive to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Blockchain has many uses, and cryptocurrency is just one of them. The blockchain serves as a ledger that contains information regarding transactions. Every network in a blockchain is regularly updated at the same time; in the case of Bitcoin, it is updated every 10 minutes. Once an entry has been added, it becomes immutable. Blockchain is also used in other areas such as smart contracts, video games, healthcare, etc.

Conclusion
In conclusion, cryptocurrencies are becoming widely accepted and possess a bright future ahead as a technological field.</p>
